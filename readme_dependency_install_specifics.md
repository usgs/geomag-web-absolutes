### Windows ###

1. You will need a terminal tool for Windows. I used [Git Bash][] to test these
   steps, but [Cygwin][] or another unix like editor should work fine too.
  1. Download [Git Bash][].
  2. Click **Next** on the welcome screen.
  3. Click **Next** to acknowledge the license.
  4. Click **Next** to keep the default directory.
  5. Click **Next** to Select Components.
     You may add Quick Launch and Desktop icons here if you'd like.
  6. Click **Next** to confirm the Start Menu Folder.
  7. PATH environment. I recommend the __last option__ here to include Unix
     tools, but if you don't understand what that entails use the
     _second option_ which still adds Git to your system PATH then click **Next**.
  8. Line Ending Conversion. Keep the first option selected, click **Next**.
  9. Click **Finish** when the installation is complete.

1. Install the newest release of [Node][] for Windows, using the Windows
   Installer (.msi).
  1. Click **Next** on the welcome screen.
  1. Accept the License Agreement, then click **Next**.
  1. Click **Next** to keep the default directory.
  1. Click **Next** to intall the default features of Node.
  1. Click **Install** to begin the installation.
  1. Click **Finish** when the installation is complete.

1. Install the newest release of [Ruby][] for Windows, using the executable.
  1. Select your language of choice, then click **OK**.
  1. Accept the License Agreement, then click **Next**.
  1. Select the check box to Add Ruby to your PATH then click **Install**.
  1. Click **Finish** when the installation is complete.

1. Install PHP, from zip.
  1. Download the appropriate zip file from http://windows.php.net/download/
  1. Unzip the folder and copy the contents into a new folder on your C:\ drive.
     `C:\php54`
  1. Add PHP to your PATH.
    1. Right-Click on **My Computer** (or **Computer**) -> **Properties**.
    1. Click **Advanced system settings**.
    1. Click the **Advanced** tab at the top.
    1. Click on **Environment Variables...*.
    1. Find **Path** under the **System variables**, then click **Edit...*
    1. Make sure there is a **;** (semi-colon) after the last item in the list, then add
       `C:\php54;`

1. Close and re-open your terminal so that your new PATH is loaded.
   Make sure to navigate back to your `geomag-baseline-calculator` project directory.
   ```git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://```
